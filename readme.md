##GeoGraphic Friend Map
I don't know who made this plugin. just doing a few minor fixes <br>

###Install
download the geoip file from: http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCity.dat.gz or perhaps over RS.<br>
The location for mine is: /opt/geolite/GeoLiteCity.dat but you could put it anywhere<br>
<br>
Also, install marble:<br>
sudo apt-get  install libmarble-dev
